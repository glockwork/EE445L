// SysTick.h
// Runs on LM3S1968
// Provide functions that initialize the SysTick module, wait at least a
// designated number of clock cycles, and wait approximately a multiple
// of 10 milliseconds using busy wait.  After a power-on-reset, the
// LM3S1968 gets its clock from the 12 MHz internal oscillator, which
// can vary by +/- 30%.  If you are using this module, you probably need
// more precise timing, so it is assumed that you are using the PLL to
// set the system clock to 50 MHz.  This matters for the function
// SysTick_Wait10ms(), which will wait longer than 10 ms if the clock is
// slower.
